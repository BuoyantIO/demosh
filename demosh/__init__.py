demosh is a Demo SHell: it reads shell scripts or Markdown files and
executes shell commands from then. However, it also outputs commentary,
shows commands before running them, and pauses before (or after) running
each command. Pausing and what to show can be controlled by inline comments
in the script itself.

For more info, see README.md. If you've somehow found demosh without also
finding its repo, it's at github.com/BuoyantIO/demosh.
